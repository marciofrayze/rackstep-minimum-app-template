# RackStep Minimum App Template

This is a very simple but functional example app build using [RackStep] (https://github.com/mfdavid/rackstep). This is
just an example to prove how simple a RackStep app can be. But for your own
applications, we recommend you to use a more complete example available at: https://github.com/mfdavid/rackstep-app-template


## Dependancies

This example app was developed and tested with Ruby 2.3.0. The only hard
dependency is RackStep and Rack itself.


## How to

To run the app, just start a rack compatible server like rackup or shotgun.

# RackStep App Template

This is a very simple but functional example app build using RackStep. This is
just an example to prove how simple a RackStep app can be. But for your own
applications, we recommend you to use the example under the app-template folder,
since it's much more complete.


## Dependancies

This example app was developed and tested with Ruby 2.2.3. The only hard
dependency is Rack itself.


## How to

To run the app, just start a rack compatible server like rackup or shotgun.
